A drupal 7 module for adding a hype banner to the website.
hype is a program that runs on the mac for creating HTML5 content.
more info about hype can be found here: http://tumult.com/hype/

I think this is one of my first drupal modules. since it was sitting at my disk doing notting I might as well upload it :)

I currently don't own a licence to Hype so my module development stopped when the trial licence expired. 
That being said I think the module is still usable but it just hasn't have all the fancy features like click -> upload your hype file so it can generate a block.
Maybe I start working on this once I buy a copy of Hype or if someonce wants to sponser me :-)

Feel free to fork this project and do with it what you want :)
